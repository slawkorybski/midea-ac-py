Home Assistant custom integration to control Midea (and associated brands) air conditioners via LAN.

Midea is an OEM for many brands including:
AirCon, Alpine Home Air, Artel, Beko, Canair, Carrier, Century, Comfee, Electrolux, Friedrich, Galactic, Goodman, Hualing, Idea, Inventor, Kaisai, Kenmore, Klimaire, Lennox, LG, Mitsui, Mr. Cool, Neoclima, Olimpia Splendid, Pioneer, Pridiom, QLIMA, Qzen, Rotenso, Royal Clima, Samsung, Senville, Thermocore, Toshiba, Trane and more.

A device is likely supported if it uses one of the following Android apps or it's iOS equivalent.
* Artic King (com.arcticking.ac)
* Midea Air (com.midea.aircondition.obm)
* NetHome Plus (com.midea.aircondition)
* SmartHome/MSmartHome (com.midea.ai.overseas)
* Toshiba AC NA (com.midea.toshiba)
* 美的美居 (com.midea.ai.appliances)

__Note: Only air conditioner devices (type 0xAC and 0xCC) are supported.__ 

See [Getting Device Info](#getting-device-info) to determine if a device is supported.

## Note On Cloud Usage
This integration works locally. No internet connection is required to control your device. 

_However_, for newer "V3" devices, the Midea Cloud is used to acquire a token & key during device discovery. Once configured, the token & key are saved and no further cloud connection is required. Devices are not linked to the built-in accounts. Concerned users may manually configure their devices by acquiring a token & key with their own account credentials via the msmart-ng CLI.

## General Features
* Automatic device discovery and configuration via the GUI.
* Device capability detection. Only supported functions are displayed.
* Minimum and maximum target temperatures provided by the device.

### Device 0xAC Features
* Support for sleep, eco, boost (turbo), and away (freeze protection) presets.
* Switch for device display<sup>1</sup>.
* Device error codes as an attribute.
* Selectable data format and scale for energy and power sensors.<sup>2</sup>
* Advanced controls (when supported by the device):
  * Purifier (Ionizer/UV/Sterilizer)
  * Device filter alert
  * Custom fan speeds
  * Service to enable the "Follow Me" function<sup>3</sup>
  * Swing angle (fan position)
  * Indoor humidity sensor
  * Target humidity in Dry mode
  * Start and monitor self-cleaning
  * Rate selection (Gear mode)
  * "Breeze" modes (e.g., breeze away, breeze mild, breezeless)
  * iECO
  * Auxiliary heating mode
  * Flash/jet cool
  * Cascade

<small>

1. Device dependent. Some devices only support display control via IR.
2. Sensors must be manually enabled on the device page. A device may not support all energy sensors.
3. Experimental. "Follow Me" requires the IR remote to transmit temperature data. More info [here](https://github.com/mill1000/midea-msmart/pull/91).

### Device 0xCC Features
* Support for eco, silent, and sleep presets.
* Advanced controls (when supported by the device):
  * Purifier (Ionizer/UV/Sterilizer)
  * Swing angle (fan position)
  * Indoor humidity sensor
  * Target humidity in Dry mode
  * Auxiliary heating mode

## Install Via HACS
[![Install via HACs on your Home Assistant instance.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=mill1000&repository=midea-ac-py&category=integrations)

Or search HACS integrations for "Midea Smart AC".

## Install Manually
1. Locate the `custom_components` directory in your Home Assistant configuration directory. It may need to be created.
2. Copy the `custom_components/midea_ac` directory into the `custom_components` directory.
3. Restart Home Assistant.

## Configuration
Midea Smart AC is configured via the GUI. See [the HA docs](https://www.home-assistant.io/getting-started/integration/) for more details.

Click the _Add Integration_ button and search for "Midea Smart AC".
![Add Device](docs/add_device.png)

Devices can be automatically discovered and configured or manually configured.

### Automatic Configuration
For automatic configuration, select "Discover devices". 

Enter a hostname or IP address to configure a specific device, or leave it blank to search the local network.

Depending on your location, a different cloud region may be necessary to authenticate V3 devices. Try selecting the closest country to your location if you experience issues.

![Discover Devices](docs/discover_devices.png)

### Manual Configuration
For manual configuration, select "Configure manually". 

Enter the device ID, IP, and port. V3 devices require the token and key parameter. This information must be [acquired manually](#getting-device-info).

![Manual Configuration](docs/manual_config.png)

---
Name | Description | Required | Example 
:--- | :--- | :--- | :---
**ID** | Device ID | Yes | 123456789012345
**Host** | Device IP address | Yes | 192.168.1.100
**Port** | Device port | Yes | 6444
**Device Tpye** | Device type | Yes | AC
**Token** | Device token | For V3 devices | ACEDDA53831AE5DC... (128 character hexadecimal string)
**Key** | Device key | For V3 devices | CFFA10FC... (64 character hexadecimal string)

## Integration Options
Additional options are available to tweak integration behavior per device.

![Integration Options](docs/options.png)

---
Name | Default | Description 
:--- | :--- | :--- 
**Beep** | True | Enable beep on setting changes.
**Reverse Horizontal Swing Angle** | False | Reverse the order of horizontal swing angles from left-to-right to right-to-left.
**Temperature Step** | 1.0 | Step size for temperature set point.
**Fan Speed Step** | 1 | Step size for custom fan speeds.
**Maximum Connection Lifetime** | Empty | Limit the time (in seconds) a connection to the device will be used before reconnecting. If left blank, the connection will persist indefinitely. If your device disconnects at regular intervals, set this to a value below the interval.
**Energy Sensor Format > Data Format** | BCD | Select the data format for decoding energy data from the device.
**Energy Sensor Format > Scale** | 1.0 | Select the data scale for reporting energy data from the device.
**Power Sensor Format > Data Format** | BCD | Select the data format for decoding power data from the device.
**Power Sensor Format > Scale** | 1.0 | Select the data scale for reporting power data from the device.
**Workarounds > Use Fan-only Workaround** | False | Enable this option if device updates cause the device to turn on and switch to fan-only.
**Workarounds > Show All Presets** | False | Show all presets regardless of device's reported capabilities.
**Workarounds > Additional Operation Modes** | Empty | Additional HVAC modes to make available in case the device's capabilities are incorrect.



## Resolving Connectivity Issues
Some users have reported issue with their devices periodically becoming unavailable, and with logs full of warnings and errors. This is almost always due to the device terminating the existing connection and briefly rejecting new connections. 

It can usually be resolved by setting the `Maximum Connection Lifetime` to a value of about 90 seconds.

## Getting Device Info
Use [msmart-ng](https://github.com/mill1000/midea-msmart) to obtain device information.
```shell
pip install msmart-ng
msmart-ng discover
```
Check the output to ensure the type is 0xAC and the `supported` property is True.
